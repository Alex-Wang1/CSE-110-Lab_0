# Zheyuan Wang's Git User Page

> Me as a programmer and a person

**As a programmer, I like to do web dev, more about front end. Since interacting with the user makes me feel
interesting than building the database, etc.**

**As a person I like inline speed skating and road cycling, just about to join the UCSD Cycling Team and looking forward
to the Fall quarter training.**
